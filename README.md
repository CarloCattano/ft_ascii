## 42 pong_cli using ft_ascii as graphics engine

### Preface

Interested in rendering graphics to terminal using just *ASCII*
The original idea was to replace mlx library with this, in order to run cub3d on the terminal ( 42 )


### The problem / learning opportunity
There are numerous implementations and literature on this matter, however, they always usually rely libs like
termios or ncurses. In here however, we are trying to do it the 42 way, without the strict norm rules.


```bash
$> make
$> ./pong_cli
```


## TODO add interface:
 - Websocket ?
 - libcurl ?
